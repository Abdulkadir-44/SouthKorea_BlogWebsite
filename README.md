# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# What is this project ?

This project is basically a website about South Korea. It is a project that briefly introduces the country by providing information about its historical, cultural, and culinary landmarks. Since I couldn't find an API to provide me with the information about the country's cuisine and places to visit, I created my own database and fetch the data from my localhost database. I have written a simple backend with Express and communicated it with the frontend. There are still some missing parts in my project, and I will continue to update it if I don't get lazy.

**Note** = NOT RESPONSÄ°VE FOR NOW
